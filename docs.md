# Documentation Manuals

The following page lists the documentation manuals provided by the _Electrostatic Sandbox Project_ in the context of embedded systems testing, simulation, and design.

## Computing Guidelines:

- [ACM Guidelines for Curricula](https://electrostat-lab.github.io/Electrostatic-Sandbox/embedded-system-design/acm-guidelines): Generalized guidelines for studying computer science utilized in approaching the self-taught route of embedded software/hardware co-design and engineering.

- [IEEE-1516 HLA Specification](https://electrostat-lab.github.io/Electrostatic-Sandbox/embedded-system-design/ieee-1516): Provides a documentation manual for the _High-level Architecture_ IEEE specification.

## Embedded Systems:

- [The AVR-Sandbox Project](https://electrostat-lab.github.io/Electrostatic-Sandbox/embedded-system-design/avr-sandbox/index): Includes documentation on basic C programming, digital electronics, AVR architecture, and embedded systems interfacing together with some circuit design.


- [Embedded Systems Design](https://electrostat-lab.github.io/Electrostatic-Sandbox/embedded-system-design/): WIP.


## Mathematics: 

- [Mathematics-I](https://electrostat-lab.github.io/Electrostatic-Sandbox/embedded-system-design/mathematics-i/index): Housing useful resusable equations and formulas in calculus, discrete mathematics, and linear algebra.

## Scientific Modelling and Systems Engineering: 

- [Preface on Scientific Modelling](https://electrostat-lab.github.io/Electrostatic-Sandbox/embedded-system-design/scientific-modelling/preface): Signifying the essentiality of using scientific modelling in various applied science fields including medicine and system engineering with some insights on models construction using the _System-Entity-Structure Framework Pawletta Model (SES)_ and the _Tricotyledon Theory of System Design Model by Wymore (T3SD)_.
