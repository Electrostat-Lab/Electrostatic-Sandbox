# The Automata Theory

## Preface:


## Table of contents:
* Computational Models.
* Abstract Mathematical Models (e.g., Continuous V.S. Discrete Mathematical Models).
* Finite Automata Models (D.F.A and N.F.A).
* Automata Languages (e.g., `L(M)` of Machine M).
* Regular Expressions, Regular Languages, and regular operations (i.e., Union - Concatenation - Closures).
* Appendixes.
  * Appendix-A: Proof by construction:
    * Proof by construction of the equivalency of both N.F.A and D.F.A.
    * Proof of construction that the regular operations are closed under the class of regular languages.
  * Appendix-B: References and More about the Automata theory.
  * Appendix-C: The use of the Automata Theory in Medicine.
  * Appendix-D: A Coding project on the _Electrostatic-Sandbox SDK_.
