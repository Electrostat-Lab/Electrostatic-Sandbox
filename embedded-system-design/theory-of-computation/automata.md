# The Automata Theory

## Preface:
Describing the computational machines can be attained through several ways; one common way, though complex, however usually used in embedded systems, is through _computer organization_ standards. Though highly accurate, it is still a concrete intricate way of describing a very specific machine or so far a family of machines (e.g., The x86 family, The ARM family, and The AVR MCU family) and there are so much details that not all computer scientists would appeal dealing with them. In addition, tackling through computer organization requires a strong background in _digital electronics_, and _embedded circuit design_. Thus, using an abstract mathematical model would be much appealing in understanding specific parts that are not easily-explained using computer organization. The Automata Models could be also utilized efficiently in a code-first approach to define software algorithms, and deal with heavy-tasking computations, so far you will find these use cases in _Appendix-D_. 

## Scientific Models and their usage
So far the _Automata Models_ are categorized under the _Mathematical Models_ which are subsets of the _Scientific Models_. Scientific Models are utilized to describe intricate systems by breaking them down into several components; then by building them up in a more _miniaturized form_, the Model. So, in plain English, Scientific models are miniaturized forms of the components of a system. The aim is to study the systems' components in an efficient way by breaking them down into managable models.
