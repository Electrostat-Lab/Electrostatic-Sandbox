# The Theory of computation

## Preface
The theory of computation is a part of the theoretical computer science that deals specifically with 3 contagious branches: 
* Automata Theory.
* Computational Complexity Theory.
* Computability Theory.

**Vision:** In the subsequent sections, we will present each one of these theories in depth from the definition to the practice. The aim of this tutorial is define these parts formally and 
enable the developer to leverage the power of theoretical computer science to solve practical problems.

The _Automata Theory_ defines abstract mathematical models that model computational tasks or sequential runtime routines that recognize a specific pattern from a set of states $$Q$$, and a set of input symbols $$ \sigma $$. It combines concepts from the _Set Theory_, _Predicate Logic_, and the _Function Theory_.

This board gives a concise summary for the _Automata Theory_:

The _Computational Complexity Theory_ deals primarliy with the performance validation of that specific algorithm modeled using the automata theory. Two major aspects are being examined, the _computational memory complexity_ which is represented as asymptotes of the ....?

This board gives a concise summary for the _Computational Complexity Theory_ using the Automata Theory and some Closures:

The _Computability Theory_ deals with whether a specific problem under a domain is solvable or not.
