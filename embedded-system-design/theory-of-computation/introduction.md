# Introduction

This document will present some prerequisite definitions and formal representations for the Sets and the Relations, alongside some examples from the proof theory that will be used in the "Theory of Computation".

## Sets: 
- Definition: A group of objects represented as a unit. A set may contain any type of objects, including numbers, symbols, and even other sets. The objects in a set are called **elements** or **members**.
- Formal description of sets:
    * Listing elements (Tabular Method): $$S = \[1, 2, 3, 4, ...\]$$
    * Set-builder notation: $$A = \[ x ∣ x∈N \land x≤5 \]$$
- Special instances of sets: 
    * Empty Set: is the set of null elements and is written as $$\phi$$, $$\phi = []$$.
    * Complement Set: is the negation of the specified set, and it's the set of all elements under consideration that are not in the specified set.
    * Singleton Set: is the set of _a single member_.
    * Unordered pair: is the set of _two members_.
    * Multiset: is a set of an additional modified property; in which the number of occurences of its members is not taken into account; thus $$S = [3, 3, 2]$$ is different from $$S = [3, 2]$$.
    * Powerset: is a set of all possible proper subsets of a set. The cardinality is the number of elements in the power set, and is calculated using $$|P(Q)| = 2^n$$; where $$n$$ is the number of members of the original set $$Q$$; Proof of the cardinality formula is made by taking the binomial 

- Operation on sets:
    * Complementation.
    * Union.
    * Intersection.
    * Exclusiveness.
    * Compound operators.
    * Cartesian product.

* N-tuple collections:

## Relations and Functions:

   * Predicates:
   * 

## Permutations
