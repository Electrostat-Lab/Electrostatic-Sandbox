# DIY Guide

This is a do-it-yourself guide to build your own lovely electrostatic-sandbox monstrosity.

The guide include the following:

**Hardware selection criteria**:
- [ ] Selection of the main board.
- [ ] Selection of the main board CPU.
- [ ] Selection of the main board GPU.
- [ ] Selection of the main board DIMM.
- [ ] Selection of the main board expansions (PCI-e) including network cards.
- [ ] Selection of the appropriate monitor.
- [ ] Selection of the appropriate boot-providing devices.
- [ ] Selection of the appropriate storage devices.
- [ ] Providing the appropriate cooling capabilities (i.e., thermal paste and cooling fans).
- [ ] Providing generic means of cable handling inside the case enclosure.
- [ ] Selection of the appropriate power supply.
- [ ] Selection of the modular devices to be attached to the workstation (e.g., microprocessor circuits and development boards).
- [ ] Selection of a case enclosure.
- [ ] Providing specific means of cable handling.

**Hardware parts Assembly**:
- [ ] Mounting the main board on the enclosure floor.
- [ ] ATX cable connection and pin description.
- [ ] HDD/SSD power and data connection.
- [ ] Mounting the GFX card on the d-sub expansion connector.
- [ ] Mounting the PCI-e expansion cards.
- [ ] Mounting the extra cooling `SYS_FAN`.
- [ ] Controlling the `F_PANEL` connections.
- [ ] Mounting the power circuit.

**Software selection criteria**:
- [ ] BIOS/UEFI Configurations.
- [ ] Selection of the appropriate operating system (commonly a GNU/Linux).
- [ ] GNU/Linux glibc and tools.
- [ ] Selection of means of programming the attached modular devices.
- [ ] Selection of means of communication with the attached modular devices (SEE: the scientific model of the project using the _Set Theory_).
- [ ] Selection of the appropriate frameworks for I/O control and data communications.
- [ ] What the `Electrostatic-Sandbox Framework` offers.
