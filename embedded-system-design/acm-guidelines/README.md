# ACM Guidelines RoadMaps 

This project is deemed for dissociating the [ACM-Guidelines for CS and CE Curricula]() into
more manageable _entities_ to learn, such that each entity is composed of multiple sets of
related _components_ known as _the modules_, and each component can be further decomposed into
subjects, the smallest building blocks in this learning scheme.

## Learning Scheme Model _"EMCSO Model"_
> E = Entities
> > M = Modules
> > > C = Components
> > > > S = Subjects
> > > > > O = Objects

## Example: Embedded Systems RoadMap using the _"EMCSO Model"_  
> E = {Embedded Systems}
> > M = {Theory of Electronics, Practical Electronics, Digital Logic Design, Microcontroller Interfacing, Embedded Software Engineering, ...}
> > > C of Electronics = {General Electronics, Digital Electronics, Analog Electronics, Circuit Design, Circuit testing, ...}

> > > C of Microcontroller interfacing = {}
> > > > S of General Electronics = {Circuitry, Ohm's Law, Kirchhoff's Laws, Superposition Theorem, Thevenin's Theorem, ...}
> > > > > O of Circuitry = {Open Circuits, Closed Circuits, Short Circuits, ...} 

## Terminology 
* An _Entity_ is a universe set that holds groups sets of similar modular subjects together, those groups
propose similar goals, and their presence together magnifies the target knowledge to the full capacity (e.g., Embedded Systems).
* A _Module_ is a set that groups related components together in a specific entity.
* A _Component_ is the logical unit of the learning modules, and represents the mental
subjects that maps the literal scientific subjects under a generic or umbrella term (e.g., Problem Solving Fundamentals,
Software Engineering Fundamentals, Embedded Systems Fundamentals).
* A _Subject_ is the building unit of the learning modules, and represents the
actual scientific subjects (e.g., Discrete Mathematics - Data Structures & Algorithms).
* An _Object_ is a very specific part (could be chapter or conceptualization) inside
a designated subject (e.g., Switching Algebra in Discrete Mathematics).
* An _Entity-Entity_ relationship.
* A _Entity-Module_ relationship.
* A _Module-Module_ relationship.
* A _Module-Component_ relationship.
* A _Module-Subject_ relationship.
* A _Component-Subject_ relationship.
* A _Component-Component_ relationship.
* A _Subject-Subject_ relationship.
