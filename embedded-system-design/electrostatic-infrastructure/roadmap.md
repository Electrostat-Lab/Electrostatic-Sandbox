This file signifies a roadmap guide to quick-start the _Electrostatic-Sandbox_ project. In this file, it's entailed that _OS Development_ and _Networking Interfacing_ basic should be attained.

## The following is a provisional outline for the recommended prerequisites before starting the development phases: 
* Networking and software:
  * POSIX Standards.
  * The C program memory layout.
  * POSIX Processes.
  * POSIX Processes Signals.
  * POSIX Processes Semaphores.
  * POSIX Processes memory info examination.
  * POSIX IPC.
  * POSIX Sockets.
  * POSIX Sockets IPC.
  * POSIX Threading.
  * GNU/Linux Dynamic Libraries.
  * GNU/Linux Static Libraries.

## Implementation phases:
* Networking Infrastructure.
  - Comm Interface.
  - Electroserial binaries.
  - Electrosocket binaries.
  - Electroparallel binaries.
  - Electropci binaries.
* Software Infrastructure.
  - Electroproc.
  - Electrothread.
  - Utilities.
  - Networking Firewalls.
  - Federation Managers and IEEE-1516 HLA infrastructure.
  - Cryptography.
* Simulation Infrastructure.
  - Human-Interface-Device Standardization (HID) on top of FOM.
  - Physics Simulation.
  - Electronics Simulation.
  - Realtime Graphics Simulation.

## Resources: 
* Programming and Operating System Engineering:
  - Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment by Richard S. & Stephan Rago.
  - Linux Interface Programming by M. Kerrisk.
  - GNU/Linux Application programming.
  - TCP/IP Socket Programming in C.
