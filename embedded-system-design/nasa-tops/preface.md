# The NASA TOPS Program

The NASA TOPS, is a short for Transform-to-Open-Science program, an initiative lead by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration that aims to praise the open science strategy to be 
adopted across the widely developing scientific projects. One of the most perplexing problems in science, engineering, medicine, and technology is the availability, and the accessibility of 
information with the assertion of its accredibility.
