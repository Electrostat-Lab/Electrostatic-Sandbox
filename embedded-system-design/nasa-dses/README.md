# NASA Distributed Space Exploration Simulation System Project (DSES)

These papers are deemed to dissociate papers provided by NASA on their DSES project into Hardware/Software System Specifications guide and execution plans. The following aspects are to be covered, and in their heart they are deemed to provide the base components for a system scientific model (aka. mind map):
* _Problem definition_
* _Dissociating the problem into components_
* _Expression of the superposition theorem_
* _Solutions to the problem components_
* _Dissociating the solutions into a component-stepwise operational model_
* _Expression of the superposition theorem_
* _Merging scientific maps together_
